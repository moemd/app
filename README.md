# Mixture of Experts Expressed in Markdown

### How to Use This Table

- **Modular Expert Swapping**: Each row represents an aspect of FMOps and how it ties in with prompting. By designing your system around these principles, you can plug in or swap out specific “experts” without overhauling the entire pipeline.
- **Prompt-Driven Orchestration**: Prompts act as the glue between experts, passing crucial metadata (task type, domain, resource constraints, etc.) so that the correct expert (or set of experts) can be activated.
- **Scalable & Maintainable**: A Mixture of Experts approach, guided by structured prompts, leads to cleaner abstractions. Each expert can be maintained, scaled, or replaced independently, facilitating collaborative development and continuous improvement.
